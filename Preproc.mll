(* The call [explode s a] is the list made by pushing the characters
   in the string [s] on top of [a], in reverse order. For example,
   [explode "ba" ['c';'d'] = ['a'; 'b'; 'c'; 'd']]. *)

(* C# PREPROCESSOR DIRECTIVES *)

(* The type [mode] defines the two scanning modes of the preprocessor:
   either we copy the current characters or we skip them. *)

type mode = Copy | Skip

(* Trace of directives

   We keep track of directives #if, #elif, #else, #region and #endregion.
*)

type cond = If of mode | Elif of mode | Else | Region
type trace = cond list

(* The function [reduce_cond] is called when a #endif directive is
   found, and the trace (see type [trace] above) needs updating. *)

let rec reduce_cond seg = function
              [] -> stop "Dangling #endif." seg
| If mode::trace -> trace, mode
|      Region::_ -> stop "Invalid scoping of #region" seg
|       _::trace -> reduce_cond seg trace

(* The function [reduce_reg] is called when a #endregion directive is
   read, and the trace needs updating. *)

let reduce_reg seg = function
             [] -> stop "Dangling #endregion." seg
| Region::trace -> trace
|             _ -> stop "Invalid scoping of #endregion" seg

(* The function [extend] is called when encountering conditional
   directives #if, #else and #elif. As its name suggests, it extends
   the current trace with the current conditional directive, whilst
   performing some validity checks. *)

let extend seg cond trace =
  match cond, trace with
    If _, Elif _::_ ->
      stop "Directive #if cannot follow #elif." seg
  | Else,   Else::_ ->
      stop "Directive #else cannot follow #else." seg
  | Else,        [] ->

   trace (see type [trace] above). *)

| (If mode | Elif mode)::_ -> mode
|                 _::trace -> last_mode trace

(* Line offsets

   The value [Inline] of type [offset] means that the current location
   cannot be reached from the start of the line with only white
   space. The same holds for the special value [Prefix 0]. Values of
   the form [Prefix n] mean that the current location can be reached
   from the start of the line with [n] white spaces (padding). These
   distinctions are needed because preprocessor directives cannot
   occur inside lines.
*)

type offset = Prefix of int | Inline

let expand = function
  Prefix 0 | Inline -> ()
| Prefix n -> print_string (String.make n ' ')

(* Directives *)

let directives = [
  "if"; "else"; "elif"; "endif"; "define"; "undef";
  "error"; "warning"; "line"; "region"; "endregion";
  "include"]

(* Environments and preprocessor expressions

   The evaluation of conditional directives may involve symbols whose
   value may be defined using #define directives, or undefined by
   means of #undef. Therefore, we need to evaluate conditional
   expressions in an environment made of a set of defined symbols.

   Note that we rely on an external lexer and parser for the
   conditional expressions. See modules [Escan] and [Eparser].

let character = single | esc | hex_esc | uni_esc

(* Directives *)

let directive = '#' (blank* as space) (ident as id)

(* Rules *)

(* The rule [scan] scans the input buffer for directives, strings,
   comments, blanks, new lines and end of file characters. As a
   result, either the matched input is copied to [stdout] or not,
   depending on the compilation directives. If not copied, new line
   characters are output.

   Scanning is triggered by the function call [scan env mode offset
   trace lexbuf], where [env] is the set of defined symbols
   (introduced by `#define'), [mode] specifies whether we are copying
   or skipping the input, [offset] informs about the location in the
   line (either there is a prefix of blanks, or at least a non-blank
   character has been read), and [trace] is the stack of conditional
   directives read so far.

   The first call is [scan Env.empty Copy (Prefix 0) []], meaning that
   we start with an empty environment, that copying the input is
   enabled by default, and that we are at the start of a line and no
   previous conditional directives have been read yet.

   When an "#if" is matched, the trace is extended by the call [extend
   lexbuf (If mode) trace], during the evaluation of which the
   syntactic validity of having encountered an "#if" is checked (for
   example, it would be invalid had an "#elif" been last read). Note
   that the current mode is stored in the trace with the current
   directive -- that mode may be later restored (see below for some
   examples). Moreover, the directive would be deemed invalid if its
   current position in the line (that is, its offset) were not
   preceeded by blanks or nothing, otherwise the rule [expr] is called
   to scan the boolean expression associated with the "#if": if it
   evaluates to [true], the result is [Copy], meaning that we may copy
   what follows, otherwise skip it -- the actual decision depending on
   the current mode. That new mode is used if we were in copy mode,
   and the offset is reset to the start of a new line (as we read a
   new line in [expr]); otherwise we were in skipping mode and the
   value of the conditional expression must be ignored (but not its
   syntax), and we continue skipping the input.

   When an "#else" is matched, the trace is extended with [Else],
   then, if the directive is not at a wrong offset, the rest of the
   line is scanned with [pp_newline]. If we were in copy mode, the new
   mode toggles to skipping mode; otherwise, the trace is searched for
   the last encountered "#if" of "#elif" and the associated mode is
   restored.

   The case "#elif" is the result of the fusion (in the technical
   sense) of the code for dealing with an "#else" followed by an
   "#if".

   When an "#endif" is matched, the trace is reduced, that is, all
   conditional directives are popped until an [If mode'] is found and
   [mode'] is restored as the current mode.

   Consider the following four cases, where the modes (Copy/Skip) are
   located between the lines:

                    Copy ----+                          Copy ----+
   #if true                  |       #if true                    |
                    Copy     |                          Copy     |
   #else                     |       #else                       |

     #endif                | |         #endif                  | |

   #endif                    |       #endif                      |
                    Copy <---+                          Copy <---+


                +-- Copy ----+                          Copy --+-+
   #if false    |            |       #if false                 | |
                |   Skip     |                          Skip   | |
   #else        |            |       #else                     | |
                +-> Copy --+ |                    +-+-- Copy <-+ |
     #if true              | |         #if false  | |            |
                    Copy   | |                    | |   Skip     |
     #else                 | |         #else      | |            |
                    Skip   | |                    | +-> Copy     |
     #endif                | |         #endif     |              |
                    Copy <-+ |                    +---> Copy     |

                    Copy <---+                          Copy <---+

   The following four cases feature #elif. Note that we put between
   brackets the mode saved for the #elif, which is sometimes restored
   later.

                    Copy --+                            Copy --+
   #if true                |         #if true                  |

   #elif true   +--[Skip]  |         #elif false    +--[Skip]  |
                |   Skip   |                        |   Skip   |

   #endif                  |         #endif                    |
                    Copy <-+                            Copy <-+


                +-- Copy --+-+                      +-- Copy ----+
   #if false    |          | |       #if false      |            |
                |   Skip   | |                      |   Skip     |
   #elif true   +->[Copy]  | |       #elif false    +->[Copy]--+ |
                    Copy <-+ |                          Skip   | |

   #endif                    |       #endif                      |
                    Copy <---+                          Copy <---+

   Note how "#elif" indeed behaves like an "#else" followed by an
   "#if", and the mode stored with the data constructor [Elif]
   corresponds to the mode before the virtual "#if".

   Important note: Comments and strings are recognised as such only in
   copy mode, which is a different behaviour from the preprocessor of
   GNU GCC, which always does.
